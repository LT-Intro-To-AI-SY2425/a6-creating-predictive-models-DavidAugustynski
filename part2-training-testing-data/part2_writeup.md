# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The model does testing and training which makes it more effective.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells me that model is close to accurate, it is not near 100% accurate.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Association’s website on understanding blood pressure.
 I'd say it's fairly accurate for the most part. When my model tests different x values, my r squared value floats around 0.65-0.75 which is not bad but can be improve This means that people of that tested age will have an actual blood pressure value which is somewhere around the predicted y value. There is a ranging margin of error for the y values though.
