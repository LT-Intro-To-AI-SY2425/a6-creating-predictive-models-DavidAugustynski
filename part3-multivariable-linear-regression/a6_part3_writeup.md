# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
    R squared coefficient was 0.94. This means the model is very accurate.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes, because the predictions are more accurate than the previous models.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
10 year: $8667.19 20 year: $648.13
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
There is not enough data with hihgher values that the model can make predictions off of. The model may go farther away from the linear trend.
